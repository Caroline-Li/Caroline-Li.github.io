Ah, *Iron Gold*, the continuation of the *Red Rising" series by Pierce Brown. Where to start?

*Iron Gold* simply has a different, colder feeling than its predecessors. Instead of the fast-paced
enery of the previous three books, *Iron Gold* weaves in dark, sinister, morally ambiguous themes of
war, freedom, and ideology. It leisurely reveals the consequences of civil war in the ten year lapse
between *Morning Star* and *Iron Gold*. Civil war, it seems, has taken a terrible toll upon the original
trilogy's characters. On the other hand, it has only emboldened our new characters with seething
ambition.

Okay, no more elegance. That paragraph already took a lot of brain power.

I actually didn't like *Iron Gold* as much as the original trilogy. It just attempts too much. There's
too many storylines, too many sub-plots, and too many characters to remember. *Iron Gold* begins
interstingly enough, but after a while, it just gets boring. That being said, I still enjoyed a few
storylines enough to pull through the ending. 

However, I really liked the themes and moral questions *Iron Gold* attempts to address. Is violence
ever the answer? How much war can people endure, before the sacrafices outweigh the conquest? More
improtantly, what is the worth of a life? Are people's lives worth the final ambition in conquest?
Are the sacrafices worth the eventual peace? And as we ponder these questions, our heroes become
twisted, both noble and cruel, mirroring their enemies. Who, in *Iron Gold*, deserves to win?

With that, I leave the answer in your hands. Read *Iron Gold* to find out!

Peace out.
