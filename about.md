I'm Caroline Li and this is my blog website about my projects and hobbies! 

**A Little About Me**

I'm a student at UT Austin studying Computer Science and Electrical Engineering honors. In my free time, I love to 
read, and write short stories. Check out my website for updated posts on book reviews, short stories, and personal 
projects!
